<h1>Pentago is a first player win</h1>
<h2>A semi-interactive explorer for perfect pentago play</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentago">Pentago</a> is a game designed by Tomas Flod√©n and
  developed and sold by <a href="http://mindtwisterusa.com">Mindtwister</a>.
  <a href="http://www.pentago.se/ENRules.pdf">Here are the rules</a>.
  </p><p>
  With the help of several hours on 98304 threads of Edison, a Cray supercomputer at NERSC,
  Pentago is now strongly solved.  This means that perfect play can be computed from any position
  in a reasonable amount of time (see below).  The above visualization lets you explore the results:
  click on a empty spot to place a stone, or on an arrow to rotate the board.  After a wait, the
  results of all moves will show up.
  </p><p>
  How long you have to wait depends on the number of stones on the board.  For moves with 18 or fewer
  stones, the result is simply read out of a 4 terabyte database (generously hosted by Rackspace!).
  Since the number of positions with increases exponentially with the number of stones (up to 24
  stones), it was impractical to remember the values of positions with more stones: the supercomputer
  generated these values in RAM but discarded them as soon as possible.  Therefore, when given a board
  whose children have 19 or more stones, the values are computed from scratch using tree search.  This
  takes a fraction of a second close to the end of the game, around 30 seconds for for the children of
  an "average" 18 stone board, and possibly an hour or more for "delicate" 18 stone boards even if
  the backend server is otherwise idle.  Thus semi-interactive.
