      <section id="intro"><h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentago">Pentago</a> is a board game designed by Tomas Flod√©n and
        developed and sold by <a href="http://mindtwisterusa.com">Mindtwister</a>.
        The rules are <a href="#rules">given below</a>.
        Like chess and go, pentago is a two player, deterministic, perfect knowledge, zero sum game:
        there is no random or hidden state, and the goal of the two players is to make the other player lose (or
        at least tie).  Note that pentago is not related to go; it is much closer to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gomoku">gomoku</a>.
        </p><p>
        Unlike chess and go, pentago is small enough for a computer to play perfectly: with symmetries removed,
        there are a mere 3,009,081,623,421,558 (3e15) possible positions.  Thus, with the help of several hours
        on 98304 threads of <a href="http://www.nersc.gov/users/computational-systems/edison">Edison</a>, a
        Cray supercomputer at <a href="http://www.nersc.gov">NERSC</a>, pentago is now strongly solved.
        "Strongly" means that perfect play is efficiently computable for any position.  For example,
        <a href="/#0">the first player wins</a>.
        </p><p>
        This site demonstrates the strong solution.  For boards with 17 or fewer stones, the result is read out
        of a 4 terabyte database.  Since the number of positions increases exponentially with the number of stones,
        the database stops after this, and the result must be computed from scratch.  This takes about 15-20 seconds
        for an 18 stone board if the server is below full load, much less for boards with 19 or more stones.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="rules"><h2>Pentago rules</h2>
        <p>
        The rules of pentago can be found on the <a href="http://www.pentago.se/ENRules.pdf">Mindtwister website</a>,
        or on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentago">Wikipedia</a>.  For completeness, we reproduce them
        here.
        </p><p>
        Pentago is played on a 6 by 6 board, divided into four 3 by 3 quadrants.  There are two players, black
        and white, who alternate turns.  The goal of each player is to get five stones of their color in a row,
        either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.  Each turn, a player places a stone in an empty space in
        some quadrant, then chooses a possibly different quadrant to rotate 90 degrees left or right.
        If both players get five in a row at the same time, or the last move is played with no five in a row,
        the game is a tie.  If a player makes five a row by placing a stone, there is no need to rotate a
        quadrant: the player wins immediately.
        </p><p>
        To use the visualization, click on an empty spot to place a stone, or on an arrow to rotate the board.
        After a short wait, the results of all moves will show up: green moves win, blue moves tie, and red moves
        lose.  You can back up either by pressing the back button, or using your browser history.  If you find an
        interesting position, you can save it by copying the browser URL, which records both the current position
        and the history of the game up to this point.

      <section id="algorithms"><h2>Algorithms: brute force + symmetry</h2>
        <p>
        I will be writing up more details of the computation in paper form soon, but here is a brief summary.
        </p><p>
        As mentioned above, pentago has 3,009,081,623,421,558 (3e15) possible positions once symmetries
        are taken out.  The number of positions increases exponentially up to 24 stones (where there are
        equal numbers of black, white, and empty squares), then falls off:
        </p><img id="counts" src="counts.svg" width="600"><p>
        Unfortunately, since each full move involves both placing a stone and choosing a rotation, the
        branching factor is very high: there are 288 possible first moves including the first rotation.
        To reduce the branching factor to a manageable level, we perform all computations in terms
        of rotation-abstracted "superpositions" consisting of all ways of rotating the quadrants of a given
        board.  Since there
        are four ways to rotate each of four quadrants, one bit per position becomes a 4-dimensional array with
        4<sup>4</sup> = 256 bits total.  These 256 bits are packed into two 128-bit SSE registers,
        allowing us to compute 256 values at a time using SSE bit twiddling.  The resulting code is
        <a href="https://github.com/girving/pentago/blob/b1aaaa2850492a1a310913a963c2c5b44cddd2a7/pentago/base/symmetry.cpp#L233">fairly hairy</a>,
        but is much faster than operating on one position at a time.
        </p><p>
        With the branching factor under control, we solve the game by traversing every possible position, starting
        at 36 stone positions and moving backwards through the game to the zero stone start.
        Around the peak at 24 stones, the computation requires 80 TB of RAM even with compression,
        and was therefore run on 98304 threads of
        <a href="http://www.nersc.gov/users/computational-systems/edison">Edison</a>,
        a Cray supercomputer at NERSC (the National Energy Research Supercomputing Center).  Positions with more
        than 18 stones were discarded after use, and those with 18 or fewer were written to disk using lzma
        compression to reduce down to 4 TB total.  The large scale computation took less than four hours, plus
        a few more hours on fewer nodes to finish up.
        </p><p>
        If this site sees a position with 18 or more stones, its children are outside the database, so we perform
        a much smaller traversal over all downstream positions.  The set of downstream positions is much easier to
        deal with thanks to abstracting away the rotations, as the set of empty spots does not
        move around.  These smaller solves have the same structure as the full solve, but require only 1 GB of RAM
        and 15-20 seconds on a single thread.  As a perk, we can take advantage of parity to store only half of
        the 256 possible rotations at each step since the rotation parity flips every move.

      <section id="server"><h2>Server setup</h2>
        <p>
        Hosting for the 4 TB data set, this website, and the backend servers that power it have been generously
        donated by <a href="http://rackspace.com">Rackspace</a>.  The data is stored in a single
        <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/files">Cloud Files</a> container.  When the backend server receives
        a request for a position, it either looks up the result using http range requests into the compressed
        data set or computes it from scratch if there are 18 or more stones.  Both of these operations involve
        significant delays, so the server is written in <a href="http://nodejs.org">node.js</a> for easy
        asynchronous control flow, using C++ internals exposed to node with a small custom binding layer.
        Data set lookups and caching are handled within the main node process, and new computations are farmed
        out to worker processes.  Since each compute worker requires 1 GB of RAM, the node.js master server
        and 7 worker processes fit nicely onto a single 8 GB, 8 vCPU Rackspace server.  If the server load is
        too high, I plan to use Rackspace's load balancing and autoscaling support to add distributed compute
        workers.
        </p><p>
        The backend server is
        <a href="http://backend.perfect-pentago.net:2048"> http://backend.perfect-pentago.net:2048</a>.  The
        API is fairly simple: give it the code for a pentago board and it replies with json containing the values
        of all child positions.  For example,
        <a href="http://backend.perfect-pentago.net:2048/0">here is the start position</a>.  You are welcome
        to use the server directly for small numbers of queries, but please email me if you want to use it
        more intensively.  Since 18 stone positions and above are very compute intensive, it is the easiest
        thing in the world to DoS attack.

      <section id="thanks"><h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
        <p>
        I am extremely grateful to Jeff Hammond and <a href="http://nersc.gov">NERSC</a> for the Edison time required
        for this project, as well as Jeff Hammond and <a href="http://www.anl.gov">Argonne National Lab</a> for small
        amounts of time on Blue Gene to help understand performance problems.  This project would not have been
        possible without this compute time.  Both Jeff Hammond and Jed Brown provided valuable advice throughout
        the project.  Thanks for helping me tilt at this rather strange windmill!
        </p><p>
        Hosting for the 4 TB data set and compute servers for this site were generously donated by
        <a href="http://rackspace.com">Rackspace</a>; thanks especially to Jesse Noller at Rackspace for offering
        to host this open source project!  Cloud storage may seem less shiny than supercomputer time, but is just
        as essential in order to make the results available to anyone curious.  Solving a game and forgetting the
        answer is no good!
